Since there is no clear definition of neighborhoods or districts for Oklahoma City, the project decides to divide Oklahoma City into nine parts by the intersections of six main highways that pass through Oklahoma City. Then, we will explore the venues of each area by using Foursquare API, which will return venues with coordinates and category. Our goal is to find the largest ratio of number of grocery stores to the number of restaurant.\n"
